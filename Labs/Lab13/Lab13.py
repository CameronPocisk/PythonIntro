# For this assignment you are to write code to run a simulation for each value of N from 1 to 1000, 
import random

# and plot the results using the matplotlib plot function.


# We would like to know the slope of this linear relationship.


# Write code to run a linear regression to find the best fit line for your dataset. Your output should be similar to the following:
# SciPy Linear Regression Solution 
#  slope:  0.6325801874018306
#  intercept: -0.02602000798390236        
#  rvalue: 0.997749733854947
